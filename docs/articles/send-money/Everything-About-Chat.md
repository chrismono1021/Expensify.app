# What is Expensify Chat?
Expensify Chat is the ideal way to collaborate on expenses or payment requests by communicating in real-time with your accountant, clients, employees, or your friends and family.

With eChat, you can start a conversation about that missing receipt your employee forgot to submit or chat about splitting that electric bill with your roommates. Through eChat, you can even request money from your friends!

# How to use Chat in Expensify
To use the chat function, download NewExpensify from the App Store or Google Play.
You can also access your account at new.expensify.com from your favorite web browser.

After you download the app, log into your new.expensify.com account (you’ll use the same username and password you use for your standard Expensify account). From there, you can customize your profile and start chatting immediately.


## Start Chatting

Select New Chat to chat one on one, or choose New Group to start a group chat.

## Workspace Chat Rooms
In addition to 1:1 and group chat, members of a Workspace will have access to two additional rooms; the #announce and #admins rooms.
By default, all workspace members will be added to the #announce room. This is where you can share important company announcements and have conversations between workspace members.


Workspace admins will have access to the #admins room. This room can be used for collaboration between admins as well as your dedicated Expensify Guide!


# FAQs
## How do I add more than one person to a chat?
Creating a Group chat with multiple people is easy. Start by clicking the green chat + button and select New Group. Search for the people you want to invite and check the circle to the far right. Once you’ve selected everyone, click the Create Group button at the bottom of your screen.


## Can I add people to an existing Group chat?
Adding people to an existing group chat isn’t possible right now, so you’ll need to make a new group chat with the latest additions.

Someone I don’t recognize is in my #admins room for my workspace; who is it?

After creating your workspace, you’ll have a dedicated Expensify specialist who will help you onboard and answer your questions. You can chat with them directly in the #admins room or request a call to talk to them over the phone.


## Can I force a chat to stay at the top of the chats list?
You sure can! Click on the chat you want to keep at the top of the list, and then click the small pin icon. From now on, your chat will stay pinned to the top of the chat list. If you want to unpin a chat, just click the pin icon again.

# Deep Dive
Chat display aka Priority Mode

The way your chats display in the left-hand menu is customizable, and we offer two different options; Most Recent mode and #focus mode.

Most Recent mode will display all chats by default, sorted by most recent, with your pinned chats at the top of the list.
#focus mode will display only unread and pinned chats, all sorted alphabetically. This setting is perfect for when you need to heads down to focus on a crucial project.


You can find your display mode by clicking on your User Icon > Preferences > Priority Mode.

Inviting someone to Expensify Chat
If the person you want to chat with doesn’t appear in your contact list, simply type their email or phone number to invite them to chat! They will receive an email with instructions and can reply directly to it to start chatting with you.
All they have to do is click the link, and a new.expensify.com account will be set up automatically for them (if they don't have one already), and they can start chatting immediately!
